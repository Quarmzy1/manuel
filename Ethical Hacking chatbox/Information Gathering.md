E.g My target is a school called example.edu.cb (University)

So we are to gather information of our target;

When conducting reconnaissance on a target like  example.edu.cb, the goal is
to gather as much information as possible in both a passive and active
manner to assess potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or attack
vectors. Gathering this information can help you understand the network,
its infrastructure, and its defenses. Here's how you can gather this
information and why each piece of it is important.

**1. Why Gather Information?**

Understanding your target's environment gives insight into:

- **Potential Attack Surfaces:** Identifying weak points such as
  unpatched systems, vulnerable software, or misconfigurations.

- **Security Posture:** Assessing how well the target is defended. For
  instance, knowing if certain ports are open or closed may reveal
  firewall rules or security measures.

- **Operational Intelligence:** Learning about employees, domains, email
  structures, and infrastructure to help in social engineering or
  phishing attacks.

- **Planning Exploits:** Once vulnerabilities are identified, they can
  be exploited using relevant techniques or tools.

**There Two Phases Of Information Gathering**

**Phases of Reconnaissance**

Reconnaissance is typically broken down into two phases: **Passive
Recon** and **Active Recon**. Let's explore both phases and the specific
techniques used to gather valuable information.

**Phase 1: Passive Reconnaissance**

In passive reconnaissance, you are not interacting directly with the
target. This helps avoid detection, as the target's systems won't flag
your activities. Instead, you're using publicly available information

**Tools:**

- dig

- nslookup

- dnsenum

- whois

- Search Engine Queries (Google Dorking)

**Why:**

- To find subdomains, servers, and the IP infrastructure behind the
  domain.

- To find mail servers or other critical systems that could be
  vulnerable.

**Phase 2: Active Reconnaissance**

In active reconnaissance, you directly interact with the target system.
This phase is riskier because it can potentially alert the target to
your activities.

**2.6 Network Scanning (Port Scanning)**

Port scanning helps identify open services on the target, which could
provide insight into vulnerabilities in the system.

**Tools:**

- nmap

- masscan

- Shodan

**Why:**

- To find open ports, running services, and their versions (which can
  reveal vulnerabilities).

- To detect firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or proxy
  systems.

**PASSIVE** **PENTESTING NETWORK**

**Discovering hosts from the outside;**

find IPs responding from the Internet. In this situation you have some
scope of IPs (maybe even several ranges) and you just to find which IPs
are responding.

ICMP is the simplest way to discovery hosts is up and running; This
sends some **ICMP** packets and **expect** responses from the target
system

ping -c 1  example.edu.cb \# 1 echo request to a host

- fping -g 199.66.11.0/24 \# Send echo requests to ranges

- host  example.edu.cb \# Tells you the sysyems is up and running

- whois \<Target IP\> \#Gives more info about the server running

- nslookup

- whatweb -a 1 \<URL Of Targert\> \#Stealthy

- whatweb -a 3 \<URL\> \#Aggresive

- webtech -u \<URL\>

- webanalyze -host https:// example.edu.cb -crawl 2

- ./fierce \--domain \<Target IP\>

- theHarvester **Â  -d  example.edu.cb -l 500 -b google**

- theHarvester \--no-error \<Target IP\>

    **Discovering hosts from the outside;**

- nmap \<Target IP\>

- nmap -PE -PM -PP -sn -n 199.66.11.0/24 \#Send echo, timestamp requests
  and subnet mask

- nmap -A \<Targert IP\> \# OS Detection

> -sV \<//\> \# Detect service version
